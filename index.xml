      <description>Here is list of my side projects
GoExpenses This is expenses app, which I am using to track my expenses. Exchange rate between RSD and EUR currencies is automatically updated daily. User can create accounts, expenses and incomes.
It is possible to use SQLite or PostgreSQL database.
That can be set in goexpenses.ini file:
[settings] databasetype=postgres For SQLite databasetype should be set to sqlite.
In goexpenses.ini file is possible also to set other parameters, like mail server, openexchange id etc.</description>

      <title>AngularJS - Minify resources and Cache Busting</title>

      <description>Single page aplication When dealing with Single page application (SPA), it is nessesary to think about minifying those js and css files, and combining those in single files, to speed up loading of app.
Also there is another issue with caching. When You release new version, browser won&amp;rsquo;t load new files, until You go into developer tools, and disable caching. But this is not a solution for production app.</description>
